# AnythingButCreed

## Instructions

1. Define a class called `Song` that has a string property `Artist` and a string property `Name`. Both properties should be required in order to construct an instance of `Song`
2. Define a List, named `goodSongs`, that will hold instances of `Song`.
3. Define a List, named `allSongs`, that contains 12 instances of `Song`.

    Make sure that some of the songs are from the band Creed. If you're not familiar with the band, consider yourself lucky and make up some songs. It's not worth googling.

4. Once the set is populated with 12 instances of song, use Linq to filter the `allSongs` list for songs where the artist is **not** Creed. Set `goodSongs` equal to the filtered result.
5. Loop to print out all the good songs:

    ```
    Queen : Don't Stop Me Now
    Dolly Parton : 9 to 5
    ```
